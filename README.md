- 👋 Hello, I’m @jgcoding2020
- 👀 Full stack development projects interest me.
- 🌱 I am currently working independently on the creation of a valuable web application. This project utilizes React.js, along with a tech stack that includes Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), JPA (Java Persistence API), Hibernate, and MySQL. Upon reaching the final stages of development, my intention is to make this application accessible to the public for their use and benefit.
- 💞️ I am keenly interested in participating in collaborative web application projects.

- 👋 Hello, I’m @jgcoding2020
- 👀 Full stack development projects interest me.
- 🌱 I am presently engaged in the development of a valuable web application using React.js in conjunction with Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), JPA (Java Persistence API), Hibernate, and MySQL. Once this project reaches completion, it will be made available to the public for use.
- 💞️ I am interesting in collaborating on projects.
